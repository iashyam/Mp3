# Algorithms listed in this repository

1.  **Least Squre Fit**: this algorithm is is used to plot the polinomial of gievn data points such that the standerd deviation is minimum.

2. **Shooting Algorithm**: This algorithms use linear regression to solve ODE with boundary value problems.

3. **Solving 2nd Order ODE using Finite Diff MEthod**: This is done is _FiniteDiffrence.ipynb_
